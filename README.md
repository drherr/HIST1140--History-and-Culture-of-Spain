Welcome to HIST-1140 History and Culture of Spain.  
Once you are ready to contribute begin by navigating to our classroom [Wiki](https://github.com/drherr/HIST1140-History and Culture of Spain
## Instructions for Getting Started in GitHub  
1. Go to github.com to set up your free account. You can use whatever GitHub handle you want (that is @blahblah) but you must use your Pitt email account for your email. When you go to sign up it is just like signing up for Instagram or Twitter in the sense that you do not put the @ symbol before your username when you are creating it. The @ is a feature only to be used when mentioning or pinging someone on the platform.    
2. Under "Choose a Plan" - select "Free"  
3. Under "Tailor Your Experiences" - skip this step (located at the bottom of the screen)
4. Verify your email address via your Pitt email account - you will receive a verification email via GitHub - For more information regarding email verification please see https://help.github.com/articles/verifying-your-email-address/  
5. Send your GitHub username/handle (example: @blahblah) to me via email.  
6. Navigate to class repository - https://github.com/drherr/HIST1140-HistoryandCultureofSpain
7. Click on “watch” (in upper right hand corner of class repository) in order for an email to be sent to you any time anyone updates something in our GitHub repository.  
8. Click on “star” (also in upper right hand corner) so our class repository appears on your main GitHub dashboard/newsfeed.  
9. Accept invitation from me to collaborate either via GitHub or your Pitt email.  
  
### Why use GitHub?  
As an academic and professional in an increasingly digital world it is important to consider our online presence. For students and faculty alike engaging and traversing a variety of digital environments is a powerful professional skill. The open access nature of GitHub and the powerful version-control of Git has placed GitHub among the most used as well as most useful tools of today's tech. developers. By asking our students to create GitHub profiles and contribute to content on this platform we are placing students in an environment where the opportunities for personal knowledge development are truly extensible. For this course we are committed to having students engage with some of the social/collaborative components of GitHub's interface ([the Repo. Wiki](https://github.com/drherr/HIST114-HistoryandCultureofSpain/wiki) and [Issues Board](https://github.com/drherr/HIST1140-HistoryandCultureofSpain/issues)) with the hope that students will engage with other possible uses of GitHub and Git outside of what falls within this course's requirements.
